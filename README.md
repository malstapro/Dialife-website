This site was created for people with diabetes. The main objective of the project is to help people collect, store and manipulate their blood sugar levels.
Tracking your blood sugar is an important part of managing your diabetes, which is why I decided to make this site accessible from almost any device with an internet connection.
As a person with diabetes, I myself need to control my blood sugar and such programs make this routine task easier.

This site is part of the DiaHelp project. This project is a set of software developed by me for people with diabetes
